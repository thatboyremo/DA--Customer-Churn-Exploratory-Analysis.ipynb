# 📉Customer Churn Prediction

## 🔍 Project Overview

Customer churn is one of the biggest challenges in subscription-based businesses.  
In this project, I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and built a Logistic Regression model to predict customer churn.

The objective was to:
- Identify key churn drivers
- Extract business insights
- Build a predictive classification model
